we are gonna use scapy which is a python library to see packets in a network,
for this we should put our netCard into monitor mode.

in Debian linux :

	sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
	
airmon-ng               just for checking the netCards
						-> output is like :
								Interface	Chipset		Driver
								wlan0		Realtek RTL8187L	rtl8187
								wlan1		Realtek RTL8187L	rtl8187
	
airmon-ng check kill       killing the processes that use the netCards that are monitor mode.

airmon-ng start wlan0      putting the netCard wlan0 into monitor mode.
							
======================================================================

after that we are going to use scapy to see the packets in the network.
if you are using kali linux it is installed by default.
or you can install it by :

	sudo apt-get install python-scapy
	or
	pip install scapy

just run :

	sudo python scapy.py
	or
	scapy

>>> conf                 checking the configuration and defaults of of scapy.
>>> conf.iface           checking the interface that we are using.
>>> conf.iface = "wlan0mon"   setting the interface to wlan0mon.

======================================================================
LETS WRITE OUR OWN SNIFFER :

	now we are going to sniff the packets in the network.

>>> wifiPkts = sniff(iface="wlan0mon",count=10)    sniffing 10 packets from wlan0mon interface.
>>> wifiPkts           -> output:
								<Sniffed: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:0 Other:10>
>>> wifiPkts.summary() -> output:
								IRadioTap / 802.11 Management 8L b0:c5:54:de:12:46 a ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff / Dot1lBeacon / SSID='vermahouse' / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / D otllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt / DotllElt 
								(this is summary of 1 packet(not 10 of them))
>>> wifiPkts[0].pdfdump()     # it is a function that shows the packet in pdf format.
>>> wifiPkts.hexdump()        # it is a function that shows the packet in hex format.
